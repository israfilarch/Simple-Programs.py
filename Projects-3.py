# Program to calculate the area of a rectangle

a = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))   # takes rectangle length as float input
b = float(input("Enter the breadth of the rectangle: "))  # takes rectangle breadth as float input

area = a * b   # calculates area by multiplying length and breadth

print("The area of the rectangle is:", area)   # prints the calculated area
